## How to battle Gary

Garry is located in the house where the spawning point is. By collecting the key inside the house, you can open the door leading to the town. At first you can not even interact with him, as he thinks little of you. You have to acquire pokemons by training in the arena or beating other pokemon trainers to be able to battle him.

# Begining

 Take a tour around the town with Alex Iorga(you have to interact with him as soon as you are out of the house), he will show you around the buildings and also the way to the next area.

 To receive your first PokeBall you must:
 - speak with the shop assistant(she will send you to doctor Oak)
 - engage with doctor Oak and he will tell you to find your first Poke Ball

## Moving Balls 

 While walking around be careful to not into the moving balls, they will drain your hp!!

## Enter the Arena and battle other pokemons

 Now that you have a pokemon, you are ready to fight in the arena. Choose one of the opponents as well as your own fighter and win battles.  From here on, you can go on to explore the wonderful pokemon world and gather as many pokemons as you can on the way.

# Following Radu Lecoiu around the Portul Vesel

 As soon as you arrive in the Portul Vesel you will be welcomed by Radu Lecoiu and by interacting with him, he will show you the way to the next pokemon opponent, the “foca”. After defeating the “foca”, you have to go upwards and exit 	

## Pass by the pokemons 

 While on your journey, you will find pokemons spred around ready to engage in a fight. Battle them to pass by and continue your adventure. From here on, you can go on to explore the wonderful pokemon world and gather as many pokemons as you can through the many areas: the Portul Vesel, Padurea Vesela, the Lazy Town and the trainer areas.

# Battle Gary's Helpers

 You will also encounter other pokemon trainers before meeting Gary and you will be able to engage with them in fights, as well as collect their pokemons. There are exactly two of Gary's Helpers, the first one in Lazy Town, blocking your access to Trainer. In Trainer Lab, you will find the second of Gary's helpers and by defeating him you can obtain the Pikachu pokemon which will aid you in defeating Gary.

## End of Game

After beating the last of Gary's Helpers, you can go past him and go through the area labyrinth back to the town where you will have to defeat Gary. As soon as you defeat him, you will receive the game ending message.
